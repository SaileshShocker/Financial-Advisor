      "GST stands for Goods and Services Tax. It is a type of tax that is applied to the sale of goods and services in Canada. GST is collected by the government and is used to fund various public services. GST is calculated as a percentage of the total cost of a purchase, including both the item itself and any other related costs, such as shipping and handling fees. GST is usually charged at a rate of 5%, although it can vary based on the province or territory in which the purchase is made. GST is generally added to the final price of the item or service being purchased.\n"
